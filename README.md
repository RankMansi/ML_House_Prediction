# ML House Price Prediction

This project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to predict house prices in Boston based on several features.

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for building machine learning models to predict house prices in Boston. The dataset used comprises various housing-related metrics like number of rooms, crime rates, pupil-teacher ratio, etc., obtained from different neighborhoods in Boston.

## Methodology

### Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes housing-related metrics collected through surveys and assessments in various neighborhoods of Boston.

### Models
Several machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting were chosen to build predictive models due to their effectiveness in regression tasks.

### Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering for better model performance.
2. Model Training: Employing different algorithms, tuning hyperparameters, and selecting the best-performing model.
3. Evaluation: Assessing models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to determine their predictive capability.
4. Prediction: Using the trained model to predict house prices for new datasets or neighborhoods.

## Results

The best-performing model achieved an R-squared value of `X` on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting house prices in Boston based on the given housing-related metrics.
